# Real-Time Object Detection App

## Overview

This Android app performs **real-time object detection** using the **SSD MobileNet** model, integrated into the app using **Kotlin**. The app can detect multiple objects in real-time by utilizing the phone's camera. The app supports identifying a variety of objects through its efficient and fast detection capabilities.

## Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: The app continuously detects objects from the camera feed.
- **Multiple Object Detection**: Detects and labels multiple objects in a single frame.
- **Efficient Processing**: Powered by **SSD MobileNet**, ensuring real-time performance on mobile devices.
- **Simple UI**: No sign-up or authentication required, making it easy to use right after launch.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: Primary language for Android app development.
- **TensorFlow Lite**: For deploying the SSD MobileNet model on Android.
- **SSD MobileNet**: A lightweight object detection model for mobile devices.
- **Android Studio**: Development environment used to build and test the app.
